# Next.js Project - Installation Guide

This is a project created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a framework for building web applications with React.

## What is Next.js?
Next.js is a tool that helps developers build websites and applications using JavaScript. It simplifies many complex tasks, such as optimizing performance, making pages load faster, and improving search engine visibility.

## How to Start This Project
To run this project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Node.js
Before you can start, you need to install **Node.js**, a software that helps run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

- Download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Choose the **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version for stability.

### Step 2: Install a Package Manager
A package manager is a tool that helps you install and manage software libraries. You can use any of the following:

- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **yarn** (requires installation)
- **pnpm** (requires installation)
- **bun** (requires installation)

### Step 3: Clone project
Clone the repository from github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yassin-hagenimana/career-platform.git
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies
Once you have Node.js installed, open a **terminal** or **command prompt** and navigate to the project folder. Run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```
This installs all the required files for the project to work.

### Step 5: Start the Development Server
Now, you can run the project locally on your computer. Use one of these commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

After running the command, open your web browser and go to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**. You should see the website running.

## Editing the Project
If you want to make changes to the website, open the file `app/page.tsx` in a code editor such as **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.

Every time you save the file, the website will update automatically.

## Fonts and Design
This project uses a special font called **Geist**, provided by Vercel. The font is loaded automatically to improve design and readability.

## Learning More About Next.js
If you're new to Next.js, here are some resources to help you understand how it works:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Official documentation with guides and examples.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - An interactive tutorial to teach you step by step.
- [Next.js GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - The source code of Next.js, where you can see contributions from other developers.

## Deploying Your Website
If you want to put your website online for others to see, the easiest way is to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app).

Steps:
1. Create a free account on **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**.
2. Connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
3. Click **Deploy**, and Vercel will take care of the rest.
